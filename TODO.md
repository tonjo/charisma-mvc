TODO
====

  - Better integrate onefilelogin with a proper model that have to be loaded
  - UI ISSUES: uploadify NOT WORKING (Check HTML page source, maybe Apache and rewrite issues)
  - Test with requirement not satisfied in constructor (PHP < 5.3.7)
  - (?) create default admin with cleartext password and then crypt it.
  - insert php-mvc-advanced examples (SQL, views, models)
  - Localization (gettext for php and Twig_Extensions_Extension_I18n for twig)
