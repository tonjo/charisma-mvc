TODO
====

  - Localization in TWIG templates!
  - Maybe remove composer.lock from GIT? Ask web

ISSUES
------
  - UI ISSUES: uploadify NOT WORKING (Check HTML page source, maybe Apache and rewrite issues)


FUTURE
------
  - ADD maybe RedBean SQLite ORM support (nice, clean, fast, easy)
  - (?) create default admin with cleartext password and then crypt it.
  - insert php-mvc-advanced examples (SQL, views, models)
  - Test with requirement not satisfied in constructor (PHP < 5.3.7)
